                <p class="paragraph">We are very pleased to annanounce that starting november 6th Marina Abramovic will
                    be here at Sunds Gallery. Abramovic is an amazing preformance artist that stirs up emotion. You
                    don´t want to miss this oppurtunity to participate in the space she creates.<br>
                    In her first performance in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture.
                    Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which
                    rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself,
                    she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After
                    cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the
                    same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to
                    explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – the pain and the sounds of the stabbing;
                    the double sounds from the history and the replication.
                    With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. "Once you
                    enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never
                    normally do."

                <p class="paragraph">We are very pleased to annanounce that starting october 15th Elizabeth Peyton will
                    be here at Sunds Gallery. Peyton works from both life and photography, generally using painting,
                    drawing, or printmaking, and often exploring successive degrees of removal from her source material,
                    such as in her paintings of Camille Claudel's sculptures in which Peyton creates paintings of
                    photographs of sculptures.[6] In her interview with Frieze magazine, Peyton expressed that when she
                    chooses to paint from another artist's work, it allows her to explore "harder-to-reach things inside
                    herself" because the composition is already decided.[7] In another manner of reworking, Peyton will
                    revisit an image that she has previously used, cropping it in different dimensions and thus altering
                    the amount of context given. This manipulation of context is significant to Peyton because of its
                    effect on the feelings of proximity and intimacy.

                    Since 1998, when Parkett magazine commissioned her to create a lithograph, Peyton has created a
                    broad range of prints, including monotypes, lithographs, and woodcuts.[8] Experimenting with
                    different techniques, she also uses a variety of diverse and handmade papers as well as various
                    colored and monochromatic inks.
